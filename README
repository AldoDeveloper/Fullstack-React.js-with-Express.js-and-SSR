# Fullstack React.js with Express.js and SSR

This project is a fullstack web application that demonstrates the use of React.js on the frontend, Express.js on the backend, and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO. The application includes an API built with Express.js and a frontend rendered with React.js, where the initial rendering is done on the server.

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** with React.js for improved SEO and initial load performance.
- **Express.js API** for handling backend logic and data fetching.
- **React Router** for handling client-side routing.
- **State Management** with React's Context API or Redux (depending on the complexity of your state).
- **Styled Components** or CSS Modules for styling the application.
- **Environment Configuration** for managing development and production environments.
